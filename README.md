# Introduction:

The preventing Heart diseases has become more than necessary. Good data-driven systems for predicting heart diseases can improve the entire research and prevention process, making sure that more people can live healthy lives. This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate.

We've used Gaussian NB algorithm of Naive Bayes classifier family of Machine Learning algorithms, implemented in Python, to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient. This is a classification problem, with input features contains 14 of parameters, and the target variable as a binary variable, predicting whether heart disease is present or not.
